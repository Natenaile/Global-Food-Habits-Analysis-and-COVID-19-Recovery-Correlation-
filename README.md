By employing Machine Learning, the initiative focuses on assessing worldwide food consumption trends to ascertain potential correlations between a nation's dietary preferences and recovery rate.

## Dataset
The remarkable Kaggler [Maria Ren](https://www.kaggle.com/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset) gathered the data, which is then partitioned into four datasets. All these datasets consist of 170 rows representing different countries and share the same 23 columns, encompassing various food categories and corresponding COVID-19 statistics for each country. While the COVID-19 statistics remain consistent across the four datasets, the distinction lies in their purpose:

* Fat Supply Quantity Data: This dataset illustrates the distribution of fat consumption percentages among the various food categories for each country.

* Food Supply Quantity in Kg: In this dataset, the consumption percentages of food supply quantities across different food categories for each country are showcased.

* Protein Supply Quantity Data: Here, the dataset presents the distribution of protein consumption percentages among the different food categories for each country.

* Food Supply Data in Kcal: This dataset demonstrates the distribution of energy intake consumption percentages among the various food categories for each country.
